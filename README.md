# The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale 7-item (GAD-7)

In recent years, GAD-7 has been increasingly applied in data-driven approaches to mental health, particularly in predictive analytics and early intervention systems. Its standardized structure enables seamless integration with demographic, behavioral, and academic data in machine learning pipelines. For example, studies such as those by Jacobson and Feng (2022) employed digital phenotyping data collected via wearable sensors in daily life to predict GAD-7 symptom severity using artificial intelligence models. Their approach demonstrated that anxiety levels could be accurately estimated from physiological and behavioral signals, highlighting the potential of GAD-7 as a reliable target variable in real-world machine learning applications.

GAD-7 also helps address subjectivity in mental health diagnosis. Previously, diagnoses relied heavily on clinical interviews, which could vary among practitioners. GAD-7 introduces standardization and objectivity, enabling consistent data collection across different settings and times. Furthermore, the scale helps alleviate the “diagnostic bottleneck” in resource-limited areas by allowing non-specialists or digital platforms to rapidly screen large student populations with minimal training requirements.
In Vietnam, several studies have initially examined the applicability of the GAD-7 scale in both educational and community contexts. The study by N.T. Dat et al. (2021) on the prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder and related factors among students at Hanoi Medical University indicated that the GAD-7 can be effectively used to detect early signs of anxiety in this population. Similarly, Pham et al. (2024) applied the Vietnamese version of the GAD-7 to assess anxiety levels among students at Phenikaa University, confirming both high internal reliability and good linguistic and cultural adaptability of the scale.

Beyond the educational setting, the GAD-7 has also been implemented in community populations in Vietnam. The study by Nguyen Thanh Gia (2024), conducted in several coastal areas of central Vietnam, investigated factors contributing to an increased risk of anxiety disorders. This research not only identified the prevalence of anxiety disorders but also demonstrated the utility of the GAD-7 in early screening of risk factors in the community. The findings suggested appropriate interventions, such as enhancing disaster preparedness knowledge, improving public health, and promoting healthier lifestyles.
